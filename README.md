### Hi there 👋

I'm Alex! I'm getting PhD in Physics from the University of Florida. 

I'm interested in Machine Learning, AI, Quantum Computing, Bayesian Statistics, Particle Physics, 
Astrophysics, Cosmology, Biophysics, Spatial Statistics, Computer Vision, NLP, and many other things.

I also do Karate, Woodworking, and like to go SCUBA Diving or Sailing whenever I can.

I'm currently working on some projects in the fields mentioned above, and I'd like to write up some nice explainers on them. coming soon...
